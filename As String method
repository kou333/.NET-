üî§ What is the AsString() Method?
The AsString() method is a custom method that you define in a class to return a human-readable string describing the object's state (its internal data). It is not built-in to C#, but it's commonly used to make it easy to display object information.

üß± In your Triangle class example:
csharp
Copy
Edit
public string AsString()
{
    return $"Base is {_base}, height is {_height}";
}
It returns a string like: "Base is 10, height is 5"

It includes the values of the triangle‚Äôs base and height

It follows the exact format required in the assignment

üÜö How Is It Different from ToString()?
C# provides a built-in method called ToString() which every class inherits from object. For example:

csharp
Copy
Edit
public override string ToString()
{
    return $"Base is {_base}, height is {_height}";
}
You could override ToString() instead of creating AsString(), but the task specifically asked for a method named AsString().

| -------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Custom method? | Yes                                     | No, it's built-in to all C# objects      |
| Purpose        | To show object info in custom format    | To return a string version of the object |
| Required here? | ‚úÖ Yes, based on assignment instructions | ‚ùå Not required in this case              |
