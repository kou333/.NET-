âœ… What is IComparable?
IComparable is an interface that helps you compare one object with another of the same type.

Think of it like this:
ğŸ‘‰ If you have a list of objects (like students, books, or numbers), and you want to sort them, IComparable tells how to compare one item with another.

âœ… Why use it?
So that your custom class (like Student, Book, etc.) can be sorted using built-in C# methods like .Sort().

âœ… What does it contain?
Just one method:

csharp
Copy
Edit
int CompareTo(object other);
Returns -1 â†’ if the current object is less than the other

Returns 0 â†’ if they are equal

Returns 1 â†’ if the current object is greater than the other

âœ… Example in Easy Words
Letâ€™s say we have a Student class and we want to sort students based on marks:

csharp
Copy
Edit
using System;

class Student : IComparable
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Marks { get; set; }

    public int CompareTo(object obj)
    {
        Student other = (Student)obj;

        if (this.Marks > other.Marks)
            return 1;
        else if (this.Marks < other.Marks)
            return -1;
        else
            return 0;
    }
}
This says:

If this.Marks is more, return 1 (this comes after)

If less, return -1 (this comes before)

If same, return 0 (same rank)
