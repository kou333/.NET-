Here's a clear comparison of throw vs throw ex in C#:

✅ throw vs throw ex
Feature	throw	throw ex
Preserves Stack Trace	✅ Yes	❌ No (resets stack trace)
Recommended?	✅ Yes (Best Practice)	❌ No (use only with modifications)
Usage Purpose	Rethrow the original exception	Rethrow or modify the caught exception
Common Use Case	Logging, cleanup, then rethrow	When wrapping in a new exception

🔁 throw — Preserves original error location
csharp
Copy
Edit
try
{
    SomeMethod();
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Log: " + ex.Message);
    throw; // rethrows while keeping the original stack trace
}
📌 This is the correct way if you just want to log or handle temporarily, then pass it on.

🚫 throw ex — Resets stack trace
csharp
Copy
Edit
try
{
    SomeMethod();
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Log: " + ex.Message);
    throw ex; // rethrows but stack trace now starts here ❌
}
📌 This hides where the error actually occurred, which is bad for debugging.

💡 When to use throw ex
Use throw ex only when you're wrapping or modifying the exception:

csharp
Copy
Edit
catch (Exception ex)
{
    throw new CustomException("Additional context", ex); // wrapping
}
✅ TL;DR
Use throw if you're rethrowing the same exception.

Avoid throw ex unless you're creating a new or custom exception.
