❓ Why can’t an abstract class be instantiated, even if it has concrete methods?
✅ Quick Answer:
An abstract class is incomplete by design. It may have some concrete (fully written) methods, but it is expected to be extended by another class that completes its definition.

You can’t create an object from something that is not fully defined.

🧠 Think of it like this:
Imagine a blueprint for a vehicle that says:

✅ It has a method StartEngine() already implemented.

❌ But it also says "Drive()" must be defined by the child class.

If you try to create a Vehicle object, C# says:

"Wait! 'Drive()' is missing. You need to make a real version (like Car or Bike) that fills in the missing part first!"

📦 Code Example:
csharp
Copy
Edit
public abstract class Vehicle {
    public void StartEngine() {
        Console.WriteLine("Engine started");
    }

    public abstract void Drive();  // No implementation
}
✅ This is OK:

csharp
Copy
Edit
public class Car : Vehicle {
    public override void Drive() {
        Console.WriteLine("Driving the car...");
    }
}

class Program {
    static void Main() {
        Vehicle myCar = new Car(); // This is allowed
        myCar.StartEngine();
        myCar.Drive();
    }
}
❌ This is NOT allowed:

csharp
Copy
Edit
Vehicle v = new Vehicle(); // ❌ Error: Cannot create an instance of the abstract class
