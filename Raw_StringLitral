In C# 11 and later, raw string literals were introduced to make multi-line and complex strings (like JSON, XML, or code snippets) easier to read and write without escaping special characters.

Syntax
csharp
Copy
Edit
string myRawString = """
    This is a "raw string"
    that preserves formatting,
    includes "quotes" and \backslashes\,
    and spans multiple lines.
    """;
Key Features:
Use triple double quotes (""") to start and end the raw string.

Supports multi-line strings.

No need to escape quotes (") or backslashes (\).

The indentation is preserved.

Example 1: Multi-line string
csharp
Copy
Edit
string sqlQuery = """
    SELECT * 
    FROM Users
    WHERE Age > 18;
    """;
Example 2: Including quotes and backslashes
csharp
Copy
Edit
string json = """
    {
        "name": "Alice",
        "path": "C:\\Users\\Alice"
    }
    """;
Example 3: Using more quotes inside
If your string contains """, you can add more quotes at the start and end, like """":

csharp
Copy
Edit
string tricky = """""
    This string contains """ triple quotes inside.
    """"";
Requirements
Available in C# 11 and later.

Ensure your project is targeting .NET 7.0 or higher or using a recent C# compiler.
