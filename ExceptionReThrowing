‚úÖ Exception Rethrowing in C#
Exception rethrowing is the act of throwing an exception again after catching it ‚Äî often for logging or cleanup ‚Äî while allowing it to propagate further up the call stack.

There are two main ways to rethrow an exception in C#:

üîÅ 1. Using throw; (Preserves original stack trace ‚úÖ)
csharp
Copy
Edit
try
{
    // some code that causes an exception
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Logging: " + ex.Message);
    throw; // rethrows the original exception
}
‚úÖ Best practice: This keeps the original stack trace, which is important for debugging.

üîÅ 2. Using throw ex; (Resets stack trace ‚ùå)
csharp
Copy
Edit
try
{
    // some code that causes an exception
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Logging: " + ex.Message);
    throw ex; // rethrows the exception but resets stack trace
}
‚ùå Not recommended: It resets the stack trace, making it harder to track where the error originally occurred.

üîç Example to Illustrate the Difference
csharp
Copy
Edit
void Method1()
{
    try
    {
        Method2();
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("In Method1 catch block");
        throw; // or throw ex;
    }
}

void Method2()
{
    throw new InvalidOperationException("Something went wrong");
}
With throw;, the exception points to Method2 where it occurred.

With throw ex;, the exception points to Method1, which is misleading.

‚úÖ Summary
Syntax	Stack Trace Preserved	Use When
throw;	‚úÖ Yes	Always preferred
throw ex;	‚ùå No	Only if modifying exception before rethrow
